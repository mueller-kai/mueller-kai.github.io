Hello and welcome, I am Kai Müller a research scientist at the Institute for Machine 
vision at Hochschule Kempten. I work under the guidance and mentorship of <a href="https://tobias-windisch.de">Tobias Windisch</a>.
In my current role, I’m deeply involved in Artificial Intelligence applied to production systems. 
My primary focus lies in the development of deep learning techniques, with a particular passion 
for computer vision, although I also explore a diverse range of AI methodologies. 
I prefer to focus on real-world benefits rather than using AI for its own sake.

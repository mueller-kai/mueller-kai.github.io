Hello and welcome, I am Kai Müller a research scientist at the Institute for Machine 
vision at Hochschule Kempten. I work under the guidance and mentorship of <a href="https://tobias-windisch.de">Tobias Windisch</a>.
In my current role, I’m deeply involved in Artificial Intelligence applied to production systems. 
My primary focus lies in the development of deep learning techniques, with a particular passion 
for computer vision, although I also explore a diverse range of AI methodologies.

## Interests

- Computer Vision
- AI Applications in Production Processes
- Human-Computer Interaction
- I believe that the transformer architecture is the most relevant for the craft. I have startet to delve into it and will continue to do so in the future.

Generally, I enjoy exploring and implementing the possibilities of how and where 
AI can be utilized to optimize processes, while also maintaining 
a focus on real-world benefits, keeping human interaction in mind and
weighing both the advantages and disadvantages.

## Education
- M.Sc. in Human-Computer Interaction, Reutlingen, Germany
- B.Sc. in Special Education, Heidelberg, Germany

## Medium
  In my freetime I wrote Medium articles regarding data science topics and for self documentation. You can find these <a href="https://medium.com/@mailmuellerkai">here</a>.

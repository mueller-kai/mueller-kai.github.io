Hello and welcome, I am Kai Müller a research scientist at the Institute for Machine 
vision at Hochschule Kempten. I work under the guidance and mentorship of <a href="https://tobias-windisch.de">Tobias Windisch</a>.
In my current role, I’m deeply involved in Artificial Intelligence applied to production systems. 
My primary focus lies in the development of deep learning techniques, with a particular passion 
for computer vision, although I also explore a diverse range of AI methodologies.

## Interests

- Image Processing
- Causal Inference
- Reinforcement Learning
- AI Applications in Production Processes
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Even though I haven't worked with Transformers yet, I believe that the architecture is the most relevant for the craft, and I would like to delve into it.

Generally, I enjoy exploring and implementing the possibilities of how and where AI can be utilized to optimize processes, while also maintaining a focus on real-world benefits, keeping human interaction in mind and
weighing both the advantages and disadvantages.

## Education
- MSc in Human-Computer Interaction, Reutlingen, Germany
- BSc in Special Education, Heidelberg, Germany

## Medium
  In my freetime I sometimes write Medium articles regarding data science topics that you can find <a href="https://medium.com/@mailmuellerkai">here</a>, some articles refere to topics of my masters thesis.

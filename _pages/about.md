Hello and welcome, I am Kai Müller a research scientist at the Institute for Machine 
vision at Hochschule Kempten. I work under the guidance and mentorship of <a href="https://tobias-windisch.de">Tobias Windisch</a>.
In my current role, I’m deeply involved in Artificial Intelligence applied to production systems. 
My primary focus lies in the development of deep learning techniques, with a particular passion 
for computer vision, although I also explore a diverse range of AI methodologies.

## Interests

- Computer Vision
- AI Applications in Production Processes
- Human-Computer Interaction

Generally, I enjoy exploring and implementing the possibilities of how and where 
AI can be utilized to optimize processes. 
I prefer to focus on real-world benefits rather than using AI for its own sake.

## Education
- M.Sc. in Human-Computer Interaction, Reutlingen, Germany
- B.Sc. in Special Education, Heidelberg, Germany

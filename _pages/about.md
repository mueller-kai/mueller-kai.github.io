Hello and welcome, I am Kai Müller a research scientist at the Institute for Machine 
vision at Hochschule Kempten. I work under the guidance and mentorship of <a href="https://tobias-windisch.de">Tobias Windisch</a>.
In my current role, I’m deeply involved in Artificial Intelligence applied to production systems. 
My primary focus lies in the development of deep learning techniques, with a particular passion 
for computer vision, although I also explore a diverse range of AI methodologies.

# Projects
## Imageminer
In Imageminer we are learning causal relations from artificially generated high-dimensional production line data. 
For this we designed image generator functions that generate images based on a DAG where causal relations are known.
We learn the causal relations between the images back from the images/ timeseries data.
This research serves to establish concepts applicable to real-world production lines.
Manufacturers are particularly eager to pinpoint aspects within their production data, 
that influence whethera part is classified as OK or NOK

## Lineflow

In our project Lineflow, we are developing a flexible and extensible Python framework for simulating production lines. 
Our simulation can be controlled by an AI. The production line with the state of the cells and the parts as well as
the AI's actions are visualized.
We can use our framework to train an AI that automatically optimizes this production line towards a metric i.e. produced parts.

## Masterthesis

My Masters thesis, also under the supervision of Tobias Windisch, 
focused on the optimization of production lines at Robert Bosch GmbH. I 
created a production line simulation using Python allowing me to simulate and 
predict potential line jams in advance using machine learning.


## Interests

- Image Processing
- Causal Inference
- Reinforcement Learning
- AI Applications in Production Processes
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Even though I haven't worked with Transformers yet, I believe that the architecture is the most relevant for the craft, and I would like to delve into it.

Generally, I enjoy exploring and implementing the possibilities of how and where AI can be utilized to optimize processes, while also maintaining a focus on real-world benefits, keeping human interaction in mind and
weighing both the advantages and disadvantages.

## Education
- MSc in Human-Computer Interactio, Reutlingen, Germany
- BSc in Special Education, Heidelberg, Germany

## Medium
  In my freetime I sometimes write Medium articles regarding data science topics that you can find <a href="https://medium.com/@mailmuellerkai">here</a>, some articles refere to topics of my masters thesis.
